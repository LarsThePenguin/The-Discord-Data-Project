Note: Code or builds are not supplied because current code is non-functional and I have no backups. (It should be functional soon though)</br></br>
â€ŽAnother Note: If you are going to store data that you even have a hint of not wanting to use, HAVE A BACKUP, This is not a reliable way of storing data.
# The Discord Data Project
This is a project, written in Python, that uses Discord bots to store files and mount a virtual disk. </br>
Main reason to not use it? It's really slow. (300KB/s - 7MB/s, it speeds up over time)
# Things to do
There's a lot of things to do, here they are, let me know if you find any more though/have any more ideas.
* It crashes after a few minutes: I have no idea why, windows just gives me a popup saying "Python has crashed, Debug?" (It says Debug because I have Visual Studio installed)
* It runs really slow: But, I know a way I can optimize it (It reuploads the entire file, just upload the changed chunks)
* Saving IDs and Permissions to a file: I have partially implemented this, its pretty simple to implement the rest though.
* Discord might not allow it: Based on the fact the limit can be anything winfspy can support, they might not like you are storing an entire datacenter on THEIR servers
# Basis
It is written in Python, and uses discord.py. </br>
(In Windows) It uses the winfspy library to mount everything as a virtual disk.
